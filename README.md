SlotMachine.js
=============

A slot machine implementantion in HTML5 using Canvas, Paper.js and lots of arrays

This app uses loops to scour the HTML document for image tags. 
Those image tags fill 3 different columns(the Fruits).

The app is supposed to be Plug+Play - It generates the appropriate values to function on-the-fly using the image tag dimensions,alt-text and src.

The spinning happens using the native JS pseudorandom generator Math.random().
