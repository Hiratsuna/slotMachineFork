Tech used

* [Paper.js] - pretty neat Canvas vector graphics library


Changing the fruit images
--------------

```sh
Some images are already defined in index.html. Change their src's  or add more.
Pay attention to the image id's/classes. Make sure you match them
```

That's cool but where are the results logged?

```sh
In the console - duh
```
